# AquaVitals - Pi515

## Overview

This project is part of the **Pi515 AI Challenge**, aiming to develop an AI-powered system that optimizes fish stocking strategies based on **weather conditions and water quality data**. The goal is to ensure consistent fish growth and survival rates by dynamically adjusting stocking numbers according to environmental factors.

## Goal

Using **machine learning** and **historical data**, this system predicts fish survival rates and recommends optimal stocking levels to help hatcheries meet their weight and release targets efficiently.

## Status

This repository is currently under active development.

3. **Option 1: Open `index.html` directly in your browser**  
   Simply double-click on `index.html` or open it using your preferred browser.

4. **Option 2: Use Live Server (Recommended for smooth local testing)**  
   If you have [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) installed in VS Code:

   - Open the `site` folder in VS Code
   - Right-click on `index.html` â†’ **"Open with Live Server"**

   Or use the CLI version:

   ```bash
   live-server
   ```

> ðŸ“¦ Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed if you want to use the CLI-based live server.
