# HatcheryAI-Pi515

## Overview  
This project is part of the **Pi515 AI Challenge**, aiming to develop an AI-powered system that optimizes fish stocking strategies based on **weather conditions and water quality data**. The goal is to ensure consistent fish growth and survival rates by dynamically adjusting stocking numbers according to environmental factors.

## Goal  
Using **machine learning** and **historical data**, this system predicts fish survival rates and recommends optimal stocking levels to help hatcheries meet their weight and release targets efficiently.

## Status  
This repository is currently private and under active development.
